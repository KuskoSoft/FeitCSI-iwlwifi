config IWLXVT
	tristate "Enable XVT op_mode"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	select IWLWIFI_DEVICE_TESTMODE
	select IWLWIFI_SUPPORT_DEBUG_OVERRIDES
	help
	  This option enables the xVT operation mode. xVT mode supports
	  special debug and testing operations that are not supported in
	  the standard operation modes, and is used for verification
	  purposes.
	  xVT mode does not support the standard WiFi operations, and
	  does not communicate with the user mode through the nl80211.

	  Enabling this options allows to fully control the HW using
	  an external tool in user space.

	  Say Y if you have the user space application and want
	  to execute debug and testing flows on the HW.

	  This option force the FW to transmit OFDM rate.

	  If unsure say N, Say Y if you have this code and want to transmit OFDM low rate.

config IWL_VENDOR_CMDS
	bool "enable vendor commands"
	depends on IWLMVM || IWLMLD
	default y
	help
	  This option enables support for vendor commands, including some
	  that don't have their own Kconfig option. Other Kconfig options
	  depend on this one as well.

	  This option mostly exists for non-upstream tagging, so best
	  leave it set to Y.

config IWLWIFI_DISALLOW_OLDER_FW
	bool "disallow fallback to older firmware images"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	help
	  This Kconfig option allows disabling fallback to older firmware images
	  to ensure tight coupling between driver and firmware releases. When
	  enabled, the dbg-cfg framework can still override this setting.

config REJECT_NONUPSTREAM_NL80211
	bool "reject non-upstreamed nl80211 commands"
	depends on CFG80211
	help
	  Say Y to disable non-upstream commands.

config IWLWIFI_DONT_DUMP_FIFOS
	bool "do not dump FIFO contents"
	help
	  If enabled, instruct the driver to not dump FIFO regions as
	  they may contain PII.
